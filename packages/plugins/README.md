# ChugSplash Hardhat plugin

ChugSplash is a modern smart contract deployment system that lets you to define your deployments inside of a configuration file instead of writing deployment scripts.

## Installation
Install the `@chugsplash/plugins` and `@chugsplash/core` packages.

With Yarn:
```
yarn add --dev @chugsplash/plugins @chugsplash/core
```
With NPM:
```
npm install --save-dev @chugsplash/plugins @chugsplash/core
```

## Setup
Import the ChugSplash plugin in your `hardhat.config.ts` file:
```
import '@chugsplash/plugins'
```

Update the `outputSelection` setting in your `hardhat.config.ts` file:
```
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
    ...
    solidity: {
        ...
        settings: {
            // you must include the following
            outputSelection: {
                '*': {
                  '*': ['storageLayout']
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
export default config
```

## Tutorial
1. In your existing contracts folder, create a contract called `SimpleStorage.sol`. Copy and paste its contents:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint8 internal number;
    bool internal stored;
    string internal storageName;
    address internal otherStorage;

    function getNumber() external view returns (uint8) {
        return number;
    }

    function isStored() external view returns (bool) {
        return stored;
    }

    function getStorageName() external view returns (string memory) {
        return storageName;
    }

    function getOtherStorage() external view returns (address) {
        return otherStorage;
    }
}
```

2. Compile your contract:
```
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Make a `chugsplash/` folder in your project root:
```
mkdir chugsplash
```

4. Create a file called `SimpleStorage.config.ts` in your `chugsplash/` folder. This will be the config file for your first ChugSplash project.

5. Copy and paste the following deployment information into `SimpleStorage.config.ts`. You will deploy two instances of the `SimpleStorage` contract.
```typescript
import { ChugSplashConfig } from '@chugsplash/core'

const config: ChugSplashConfig = {
  // Configuration options for the project:
  options: {
    projectName: 'My First Project',
    projectOwner: '0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266',
  },
  // Below, we define all of the contracts in the deployment along with their state variables.
  contracts: {
    // First contract config:
    FirstSimpleStorage: {
      contract: 'SimpleStorage',
      variables: {
        number: 1,
        stored: true,
        storageName: 'First',
        otherStorage: { '!Ref': 'SecondSimpleStorage' }, // Reference to SecondSimpleStorage
      },
    },
    // Second contract config:
    SecondSimpleStorage: {
      contract: 'SimpleStorage',
      variables: {
        number: 2,
        stored: true,
        storageName: 'Second',
        otherStorage: '0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111',
      },
    },
  },
}
export default config
```

Notice that we assign values directly to the state variables in the config file. There is no need for a constructor or initializer function in the contract.

6. Deploy the contracts locally:
```
npx hardhat chugsplash-deploy
```

### Testing your deployments

1. In your existing test folder, create a new test file called `SimpleStorage.spec.ts`.

2. Copy and paste the following into `SimpleStorage.spec.ts`:
```typescript
import { expect } from 'chai'

describe('SimpleStorage', () => {
  let FirstSimpleStorage
  let SecondSimpleStorage
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // You must reset your ChugSplash deployments to their initial state here
    await chugsplash.reset()

    FirstSimpleStorage = await chugsplash.getContract('FirstSimpleStorage')
    SecondSimpleStorage = await chugsplash.getContract('SecondSimpleStorage')
  })

  it('initializes correctly', async () => {
    expect(await FirstSimpleStorage.getNumber()).equals(1)
    expect(await FirstSimpleStorage.getOtherStorage()).equals(SecondSimpleStorage.address)
    expect(await SecondSimpleStorage.isStored()).equals(true)
    expect(await SecondSimpleStorage.getStorageName()).equals('Second')
  })
})
```

3. Run the test:
```
npx hardhat test test/SimpleStorage.spec.ts
```

## How it works

ChugSplash uses deterministic proxies to deploy contracts and set their state variables. An important point to mention is that the values of state variables are set in the proxy, *not* in the implementation contract. For example, the `number` variable from the `FirstSimpleStorage` contract is set to `1` *only* in the proxy contract. If you attempt to query the `number` from the implementation contract, it would return the default value, `0`. This is standard behavior for proxies, but it can be surprising if you haven't used proxies before. If you want the proxy to be non-upgradeable, you can set the `projectOwner` parameter in the ChugSplash config file to the zero-address. If this is confusing or problematic for your use case, please reach out to @samgoldman0 on Telegram.

## Current limitations
* Deployments are only supported on the local Hardhat Network.
* The only variable types that are currently supported by ChugSplash are:
  * Booleans
  * Unsigned integers
  * Addresses
  * Strings that are <= 31 bytes
  * Bytes value types, i.e. bytes1, bytes2, â€¦, bytes32. (Not dynamic bytes)
  * Contract references (using `{ "!Ref: ..." }` syntax).
* Immutable variables are not supported.
* You cannot call contracts inside the constructor of any of your deployed contracts.
* References to contracts in other config files are not supported (i.e. `{"!Ref: MyOtherProject.OtherContract "}`)
* You cannot use ChugSplash to upgrade existing contracts.
* Source code is not automatically verified on Etherscan or Sourcify.
* Contract ABIs, source code, and deployment configs are not published to NPM.

All of these features will be supported in the near future. If you need any of these features before you can start using ChugSplash for your projects, reach out to @samgoldman0 on Telegram and it will be prioritized.
